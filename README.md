## What's Inside

### Exercises

<details id=1 open>
<summary><h2>Exercise 1: Create Your First Workflow</h2></summary>

In this exercise, you will create a basic workflow that runs a simple shell command.

1. Create a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory named `first-workflow.yml`.
2. Define a workflow named "First Workflow".
3. Configure it to run on every push.
4. Add a job that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
